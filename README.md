# Data-Science-Mastery

_Nobody got ready by waiting. You get ready by starting - JOHN MAXWELL_

This is a Mastery Roadmap for postgraduate studies in Data Science (Machine Learning)

Leveraging my background as a data analyst at the Right to Information (RTI) Commission, Ghana, I specialize in the intersection of Data Governance and Empirical Research. My focus is on utilizing advanced analytics to transform public sector data into accountable, research-driven insights. I graduated with First Class Honors in Telecommunication Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I am seeking to pursue a masters in Data Science (Machine Learning). 

Teaching Mathematics to college and university students, I have gained a strong affinity for Mathematics and have gained an interest in contributing to research on how mathematics generally propels models in machine learning. I am purposefully looking to shift career into the academia.
