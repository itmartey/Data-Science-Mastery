# Data-Science-Mastery
This is a Mastery Roadmap for postgraduate studies in Data Science. "NOBODY GOT READY BY WAITING. YOU GET READY BY STARTING - JOHN MAXWELL"

Leveraging my background at the Right to Information (RTI) Commission, Ghana, I specialize in the intersection of Data Governance and Empirical Research. My focus is on utilizing advanced analytics to transform public sector data into accountable, research-driven insights while engineering robust privacy-preserving architectures.
