# The First R project 
----
This project represents my first overview and studies into the R ecosystem. It focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Sierra Leone Ebola dataset from the tutorial materials on <https://thegraphcourses.org>
The goal was to transform raw epidemiological data into a structured, reproducible report that identifies key demographic and geographical trends.

## METHODS EMPLOYED 
**Automated Data Pipeline:** Utilised the pacman and tidyverse packages for efficient data loading and cleaning.

**Statistical Summaries:** Performed univariate analysis on patient demographics (Age, Sex, District) using janitor for frequency tables and pander for professional rendering.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Implemented distribution plots to visualize the "shape" of the outbreak across different age groups.

**Reproducible Reporting:** Developed using R Markdown with the Cayman theme to ensure findings are clear, scannable, and ready for stakeholders.

## TOOLS USED 
**Language:** R

**Environment:** RStudio / R Markdown

## Repository Structure

RPractice_01.Rmd: The source code containing all R logic and documentation used for the ebola analysis 

RPractice_01.html: The final rendered report. Download raw file (Viewable via web browser).

ebola_sierra_leone.csv Exported summary data 

**Key Packages:** tidyverse (Data manipulation), janitor (Cleaning & Tabulation), pander (Reporting).
