# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview
**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis   
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This is actually my sql_practice. I am aiming to master techniques and algorithms related to Data Science. I would be reading a Masters in Data Science at a German University soon. This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. 

## Objectives
1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE, 
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,    
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,   
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT)
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Find all transactions in the Clothing category where 4 or more items were sold during November 2022**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sales_retail
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND quantity >= 4
ORDER BY transactions_id ASC;
```


2. **"What is the total revenue and the total number of orders generated by each product category?**
```sql 
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS Total_Sales,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_orders
FROM Sales_retail
GROUP BY category;
```

3. **What is the average age of customers purchasing items from the 'Beauty' category?**
```sql 
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age),2) AS Average_age_of_customers_in_Beauty_category
FROM Sales_retail
	WHERE Category = 'Beauty';
```

4. **What are the transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000?**
```sql  
SELECT * FROM Sales_retail
	WHERE total_sale>1000
```

5. **What is the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category?**
```sql 
SELECT 
 	gender,
	category,
	COUNT (transactions_id) AS total_transactions
FROM Sales_retail
GROUP BY gender,category
ORDER BY category;
```

6. **What is the average sale for each month? Find out best selling month in each year ?**
```sql 
SELECT 
		year,
		month,
		avg_sale
FROM 
(
	SELECT 
	    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
	    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
	    ROUND(AVG(total_sale)::numeric,2) AS avg_sale,
		SUM(total_sale) AS Total_Sale, 
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
	FROM Sales_retail
	GROUP BY 1,2
)as t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```

7. **"What are the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales ?**
```sql
SELECT
		customer_id,
		SUM(total_sale) AS Customer_Sale,
		COUNT(Customer_id) AS Number_of_Visits
FROM Sales_retail
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

8. **Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category**
```sql 
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM Sales_retail
GROUP BY category;
```

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

Completing this project marks a significant milestone in my data science journey. I began by reading **SQL MADE EASY BY ALEX WADE**. I went on to go through the materials from the **ALX Data Analytics programme**  I studied from the **Explore AI**. This initial project which tackles basic to intermediary queries was inspired by **Zero Analyst** on YouTube. I demonstrated moving beyond basic queries to implement advanced aggregations. I am looking to do more exploratory analysis and be able to grasp more complex window and aggregate functions.
